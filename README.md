# Machine Learning for Economic Forecasting: EDA, Data Mining, Time Series and KNIME Analytics

Welcome to the **Machine-Learning-Project**, a collaborative effort focused on forecasting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and analyzing key economic indicators using modern machine learning techniques. This project incorporates exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced time series modeling, and practical workflow automation leveraging the **Meta Prophet** library and **KNIME Analytics Platform**.

## üìä Project Overview

**Goals:**
- **Accurate GDP Forecasting:** Predict future GDP with high precision.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Identify and interpret significant economic indicators.
- **Tool Proficiency:** Master *Meta Prophet* and *KNIME* for time series analytics.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Sources

- **EDA:** 
  - Economies of Scale Dataset
  - Employee Salary Dataset
- **Prophet:** 
  - Airline Passengers Monthly Travel Data
- **KNIME:** 
  - Adult Population Dataset

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Colab (Python):** For data manipulation, analysis, and regression modeling
- **Meta Prophet:** Additive time series forecasting modeling
- **KNIME Analytics:** Data integration, workflow automation, and visualization

---

## üö¶ Methodology

### 1. EDA & Data Cleaning
- Impute missing values using statistical methods.
- Handle outliers via winsorization and transformations.
- Produce descriptive statistics (mean, median, stdev).

### 2. Visualization
- Generate histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots.
- Example: Linear relationship between TV Ad Budget & Sales.

### 3. Modeling
- **Linear & Polynomial Regression:** Capture non-linear dependencies for cost prediction.
- **EWMA:** Smoothing time-series data, anomaly detection, feature selection.
- **Meta Prophet:** Forecasting with seasonality and trend components.
- **KNIME Decision Tree Classifier:** Predict income category; visualize decision paths.

---

## üßÆ Key Results

- **Polynomial regression** improved predictive accuracy over linear models.
- **EWMA** revealed long-term patterns and reduced noise in temporal data.
- **Decision tree** identified *education*, *occupation*, and *work hours* as major drivers of income.
- Achieved robust model accuracy; further improvement planned through feature engineering and ensemble methods.

---

## üöÄ Future Work

- Fine-tune models for better accuracy.
- Hybridize EWMA with LSTMs or Random Forests for anomaly detection.
- Expand to real-world datasets for broader applicability.
